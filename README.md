Overview
Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for ensuring the best possible health outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on their health parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of [number] samples with [number] features including Glucose levels, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, and more. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the feature values. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2
From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent
(several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome)

Code Overview
The project code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, and machine learning. The main steps include:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration: Statistical measures and visualizations are used to gain insights into the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed, including handling missing values and standardizing feature values.
Model Training: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained to predict the onset of diabetes.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on both training and testing datasets to assess its performance.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict diabetes onset for new input data.



How to Use
To run this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or google colab script to execute the code.

or

just open  the file of the project you will find a colab button at the top of the page navigating you to the project


Results
The trained machine learning model achieves an accuracy of approximately 72.2 on the test dataset because of Lack of Sufficient Data: Having a small dataset can limit the ability of the model to learn complex relationships. More data often leads to better performance. This indicates its effectiveness in predicting diabetes onset based on the provided features.

Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to provide insights into the dataset and model performance. These visualizations include:

Distribution of Outcome (Positive/Negative)
Correlation Matrix
Box Plots of Features
Pairwise Relationships
Glucose Level vs. Outcome
Histograms of Features
Scatter Plot of Glucose vs. Insulin
For a detailed overview of the visualizations, refer to the Visualizations section in the code.
